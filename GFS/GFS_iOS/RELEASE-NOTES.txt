Known issue: 

Retrieving search suggestions from the Web Service sometimes takes a while to load. In one instance, the connection timed out.

Change Updates:

Products previously added to a saved list now appear as “highlighted” rows at the top of the list when searching. 

The “highlighted” rows show the name of the saved list associated with the product.

The app now uses Json.Net to parse JSON results from the Webservice (it previously used a Json library that only targetted Mono-touch applications.

Previous bugs related to searching have been resolved.

iOS dependencies in the codebase have been further de-coupled from the project’s data layer to allow for future cross-platform development.
